## こんにちは, current_user
Top 10 Anime Betrayals

My next step to becoming a full-stack software developer was quite a hurdle. After building my [first Ruby app](https://github.com/quelluomo/ilpost) not too long ago, I then moved to Sinatra and ActiveRecord, and Flatiron - the school I'm attending - requested that I built an app as my final project. Without further ado, here is what I learned.


> **1. The Schrodinger's code is <strike>alive</strike> dead**

I've been quite happy with Flatiron so far, but it is worth mentioning that some of the lessons this time around weren't the most thorough. In many occasions, I felt like they skipped some potentially vital info, and the result of it was that it took me way longer than I expected to finish the module. Perhaps it's just me. Perhaps not. Who knows.

> **2. The Schrodinger's code is <strike>dead</strike> alive**

Weirdly though, the final application I built felt way simpler to construct than the previous one, in spite of being substantially more complex and with a lot more code - Anitra uses ActiveRecord, Ruby, Sinatra, HTML and CSS extensily. Again, maybe the extra time I spent on the module helped, but it's a weird feeling.

> **3. Anitra will probably not replace My Anime List (yet)**

Despite this, it feels like a nice accomplishment. Users can sign-up and sign-out, build their lists, edit them, delete items, have secure sessions, and mark their progress with the series they love. There's a lot of code involved, and a lot of thinking required.

> **4. If you're too lazy to fork and clone the app, here is a video of it**

> **6. Using Bulma in my anime tracker feels just right**

I started my application using Bootstrap, and it was all nice and sweet, but I couldn't miss the chance of using Bulma (a CSS Framework that share its name with one of Dragon Ball's main characters), so I did it, and it turned out alright. Bulma is a nice alternative to Bootstrap, it has a mobile-first approach, and I'll definitely explore it more in the future, given how easy to use it is.

This is the part when I confess that - as always - there aren't 10 actual points in my 10-point list. To make up for it, here is an [actual list of 10 Anime Betrayals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIEleCEtqzA), brought to you by the same people of made a [top 10 list of booty songs.](https://youtu.be/RZYuTp8CB3I) Internet is a weird place.
