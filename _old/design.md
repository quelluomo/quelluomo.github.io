(Under construction)
<p>
I work mainly with InDesign, Photoshop and Illustrator and I make
<h1><a class= "pink" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DdNGysPomTrVgzvznIxjbdoNxT_8IGEr" rel="ext">nice, clean designs for humans</a></h1>
<h2 class = "blue">and occasionally robo-vampire-zombies</h2><br>

I'm now getting comfortable with Affinity Publisher, Photo, and Designer.</p>
