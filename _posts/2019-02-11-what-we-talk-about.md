# What we talk about when we talk about <strike>l̶o̶v̶e̶ </strike>
 # ＣＬＩ░ＤΛＴΛ░ＧΣＭ░ＰＲ♢ＪΣＣＴS

You almost completed your Ruby module and you're like "This is cool. I got everything sorted." and you're not entirely wrong, you have afterall completed a lot of assignments and studied a lot and though a lot about coding, to the point that you'd wake up sometimes at night and tell yourself "This is cool. I got everything sorted."

And then you start working on your first real project on your own, and you read the specs and you think that now you've taken the small side wheels off your bicycles and it'll be time to start riding on your own with a bit of balance if you don't wanna spend your life laying on the asphalt.

You watch Avi's video, and he makes it seems accessible. You watch the video again. You got this, afterall, right.

You decide to make a news reader that scrapes an Italian online newspaper, [](https://www.ilpost.it/), and you're genuinly excited about your idea, so you open up Learn and open a new notes file and frantically start typing pseudo-code that you'll it'll help you visualise your final code better, and yes, yes, it does help, so you jot down a note that says:

> **1. Writing Pseudo code helps**

You want something like this:

```
1. Title
    Subtitle
		url to the the actual page

2. Title
    Subtitle
		url to the the actual page

		#and so on...

```



Then you ~~copy~~ take inspiration from Avi's folder structure and create your folders, and work on structuring your scraper.

The website you chose has a fairly easy construction. It looks like this:

All the news have a `div > h2 > a` structure, so scraping should be easy, right? Well, no. But also yes.

You manage to scrape everything successfully, and you easily get the `first` news title, subtitle and url, but now what?
Everytime you scrape the website, everything shows up as supermassive single object, and you're like "Hmmmnnnn".

You jot down another note:

> **2. Reviewing old lessons helps**

because

> **3. You think you got it, but you might be wrong**

You think you'll never make it to the end and that you started swimming thinking you were in a pond when you were actually in the ocean.

You decide to stop scraping and start reviewing lessons until you notice there is an iteration you used over and over in the past weeks that does exactly what you have been looking for all this time.

Magically, all your code now works. You type few letters and *boom!* things happen on screen.

You realise you *actually were swimming in a pond this whole time*. You pat yourself on the shoulder and take a second to congratulate yourself, and write down a fourth point:

**4. You are still learning. Take your time, review old lessons, review your code, and what seems the ocean will turn out being just a pond**

You then wrap the project, publish a video, and remember you still need to write a blog post about it, so you do it, and while you think that if anyone would like to check the repo out, they should follow a link that may or may not look like this one: [](https://github.com/quelluomo/ilpost).

Finally, you definitely don't want to make your post sounds like a list of motivational quotes, so you scroll through the homepage of imgur and find a random unrelated gif, so you add a fifth point that looks like thiis:

> **5.:**
