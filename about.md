#I'm a graphic designer and developer currently based in Cagliari, Italy.
</p>

<p>The bulk of my graphic design experience is in the commercial, advertisement, and hospitality industries. <br>
I do a lot of menu√üs, flyers, adverts, and social media content. I design posters and newsletters.</p>

<p>I am studying to become a full stack web developer at FlatIron School New York, where I am learning to build cool apps, websites, database, and much more.</p>

<p>Please get in touch!</p>
